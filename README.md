Need to be generic tell about your bussiness we will genereate a systemPrompt and extract the data and RAG.

- A multiagent to anayslis the problem for agentic RAG.




TO run qdrant:

docker run \
  -p 6333:6333 \
  -p 6334:6334 \
  --memory=2048mb \
  -v qdrant_data:/qdrant/storage \
  qdrant/qdrant:latest





A agent will indetify the user intent ask clarify question if the question not clear mean else split the question in two sub if it is complex
else it will do simple RAG and find the solution 

A orchsiter agent must need to have the domain knoweldege about problem we are solving.

if it is complex
    - split and assign the task to multiple agent who has tool attached
    - collect response from them and answer the question

TODO
- Need prove that my apporach is better or does my apporach will work with single agent itself just adding prompt break it by yourself and see how it will work.


# RAG System Evaluation Guide: Choosing the Best Configuration Without Ground Truth Data

When developing a RAG system with multiple chunking methods and embedding models, selecting the optimal configuration presents a significant challenge, especially without existing question-answer datasets. This comprehensive guide outlines proven methodologies and frameworks for evaluating RAG performance to help you determine which setup works best for your specific use case.

## Synthetic Dataset Generation for Evaluation

### Automated Question-Answer Generation

Since you don't have existing questions or datasets, the most effective approach is generating synthetic evaluation data from your documents. This process involves using LLMs to automatically create question-answer pairs based on your document corpus:[1][2][3]

**Question Generation Process:**
- Extract relevant contexts from your documents
- Use an LLM (like GPT-4, Claude, or Mistral) to generate diverse questions for each context
- Create corresponding reference answers based on the document content
- Generate 10-20 questions per document for comprehensive coverage[4][5]

**Implementation Example:**
```python
# Generate questions from document chunks
def generate_questions(document_chunk, num_questions=5):
    prompt = f"""
    Based on the following context, generate {num_questions} diverse, 
    factual questions that can be answered using this information:
    
    Context: {document_chunk}
    
    Generate questions of varying complexity and types.
    """
    return llm.generate(prompt)
```

### Benefits of Synthetic Data Generation

Synthetic datasets offer several advantages for RAG evaluation:[2][3]
- **Scalability**: Generate hundreds of test cases automatically
- **Controllability**: Create questions targeting specific scenarios or edge cases  
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Avoid expensive manual annotation
- **Customization**: Tailor questions to your specific domain and use case

## Reference-Free Evaluation Frameworks

### RAGAS Framework

RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment) is the most popular framework for evaluating RAG systems without ground truth. It provides three core metrics that form the "RAG Triad":[6][7][8]

**1. Context Relevance**
- Evaluates whether retrieved documents are relevant to the user query
- Uses LLM-as-a-judge to assess retrieval quality
- Helps identify issues with your embedding model or chunking strategy

**2. Faithfulness (Groundedness)**
- Measures whether the generated answer is factually consistent with retrieved context
- Detects hallucinations and unfounded claims
- Critical for ensuring answer reliability

**3. Answer Relevance**
- Assesses how well the final response addresses the original question
- Evaluates the generation component's performance
- Ensures responses are helpful and on-topic

### Implementation with RAGAS

```python
from ragas.metrics import (
    Faithfulness,
    ResponseRelevancy, 
    LLMContextPrecisionWithoutReference
)

# Initialize metrics
metrics = [
    Faithfulness(),
    ResponseRelevancy(),
    LLMContextPrecisionWithoutReference()
]

# Evaluate your RAG pipeline
results = ragas.evaluate(
    dataset=evaluation_dataset,
    metrics=metrics,
    llm=evaluation_llm,
    embeddings=evaluation_embeddings
)
```

## LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation

### Core Methodology

LLM-as-a-Judge has emerged as a practical alternative to human evaluation. This approach uses an LLM to assess generated outputs based on predefined criteria:[9][10][11]

**Evaluation Types:**
- **Reference-free**: Judge responses based on quality criteria without ground truth
- **Reference-based**: Compare against expected answers when available
- **Pairwise comparison**: Choose between two response candidates

### Custom Evaluation Criteria

Design evaluation prompts targeting specific quality dimensions:[12][13]

```python
# Example groundedness evaluation
groundedness_prompt = """
You are evaluating if an answer is grounded in the provided context.

Context: {context}
Question: {question}
Answer: {answer}

Is the answer fully supported by the context? 
Rate: True/False and explain your reasoning.
"""
```

## Chunking Strategy Evaluation

### Key Findings from Research

Recent comprehensive studies have revealed important insights about chunking methods:[14][15]

**Optimal Chunking Strategies:**
- **Recursive token-based chunking** consistently outperforms other methods
- **Chunk size of 100-128 tokens** with 20% overlap shows best results
- **Small overlapping chunks** generally outperform large monolithic chunks
- **ColBERT with SentenceSplitter** achieved highest performance across datasets[14]

### Evaluation Metrics for Chunking

Compare different chunking strategies using these retrieval metrics:[16][14]
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**: Measures ranking quality
- **NDCG@k**: Evaluates relevance ranking with position bias
- **Recall@k**: Assesses retrieval completeness
- **Precision@k**: Measures retrieval accuracy

## Embedding Model Comparison

### Benchmarking Approach

When comparing embedding models without labeled data, focus on these evaluation dimensions:[17][18][19]

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Retrieval accuracy**: How often the correct document appears in top-k results
- **Semantic relevance**: Quality of retrieved context for questions
- **Computational efficiency**: Embedding time and inference latency

**Leading Models Based on Benchmarks:**
- **Mistral-embed**: Highest accuracy (77.8%) for retrieval tasks[17]
- **Nomic Embed v1**: Strong accuracy (86.2%) with good balance[18]
- **BGE models**: Excellent accuracy-performance trade-off[18]
- **E5 variants**: Consistent performance across domains[19]

## Comprehensive Evaluation Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Generate Synthetic Dataset**
```python
# Create evaluation dataset
evaluation_data = []
for document in your_documents:
    questions = generate_questions(document)
    for question in questions:
        eval_item = {
            'question': question,
            'contexts': [document],
            'ground_truth': generate_reference_answer(question, document)
        }
        evaluation_data.append(eval_item)
```

**2. Test Multiple Configurations**
```python
# Define test configurations
configs = [
    {'chunking': 'recursive', 'chunk_size': 100, 'overlap': 20, 'embedding': 'bge-large'},
    {'chunking': 'recursive', 'chunk_size': 128, 'overlap': 16, 'embedding': 'nomic-embed'},
    {'chunking': 'sentence', 'chunk_size': 256, 'overlap': 32, 'embedding': 'e5-large'},
]

# Evaluate each configuration
results = {}
for config in configs:
    rag_pipeline = build_rag_pipeline(config)
    score = evaluate_with_ragas(rag_pipeline, evaluation_data)
    results[config_name] = score
```

**3. Analyze Results**
```python
# Compare configurations
best_config = max(results.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['overall_score'])
print(f"Best configuration: {best_config[0]}")
print(f"Scores: {best_config[1]}")
```

## Advanced Evaluation Techniques

### Multi-Dimensional Assessment

Evaluate your RAG system across multiple dimensions:[13][9]

**Retrieval Quality:**
- Context relevance to queries
- Diversity of retrieved passages
- Coverage of relevant information

**Generation Quality:**
- Factual accuracy and faithfulness
- Completeness of answers
- Coherence and readability

**System Performance:**
- Response latency
- Resource utilization
- Scalability characteristics

### Production Monitoring

Implement continuous evaluation for production systems:[20][21]

```python
# Reference-free monitoring metrics
def monitor_rag_quality(query, retrieved_docs, generated_answer):
    scores = {
        'context_relevance': evaluate_context_relevance(query, retrieved_docs),
        'answer_groundedness': evaluate_groundedness(retrieved_docs, generated_answer),
        'answer_relevance': evaluate_answer_relevance(query, generated_answer)
    }
    return scores
```

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### For Optimal Results

**Dataset Generation:**
- Create 100-500 diverse question-answer pairs for robust evaluation[1]
- Include various question types (factual, reasoning, multi-hop)
- Generate edge cases and challenging scenarios

**Evaluation Strategy:**
- Use multiple metrics to get comprehensive insights[7][6]
- Compare relative performance rather than absolute scores
- Validate synthetic data with domain experts when possible

**Configuration Testing:**
- Test systematic variations of chunk sizes (64, 100, 128, 256 tokens)[14]
- Compare multiple embedding models on your specific domain[17]
- Consider computational constraints in your selection

**Iterative Improvement:**
- Start with reference-free metrics for quick iteration[20]
- Add reference-based evaluation when ground truth becomes available
- Monitor performance continuously in production

This framework provides a systematic approach to evaluate your RAG configurations without requiring pre-existing datasets. By generating synthetic evaluation data and using reference-free metrics, you can identify the optimal combination of chunking methods and embedding models for your specific use case.
